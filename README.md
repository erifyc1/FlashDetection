# CS497_FlashDetection

The research looks into the critical issue of photosensitive seizures caused by flashing content on web pages, with a focus on adhering to the online Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 2.3.1 is a success criterion. This criterion is intended to eliminate content that flashes more than three times in one second or exceeds predefined flash thresholds. Its goal is to ensure accessibility for people suffering from photosensitive seizures. Many algorithms are currently available to detect and mitigate the impact of flashing content. The study investigates and evaluates several algorithms, taking into account their effectiveness in identifying stimuli that may cause seizures. The goal is to increase web content accessibility by identifying and resolving any risks associated with flashing elements. The research comprises a detailed analysis of several flash detection algorithms using a carefully selected collection of movies, with a particular emphasis on STEM-based lecture films. The evaluation aims to analyze the algorithms' ability to identify flashes reliably while taking into account the unique characteristics of educational content and its usefulness in varied situations. The final version of the paper will include a thorough examination of current flash detection algorithms, specifically tailored for STEM-focused lecture videos. This analysis will examine the benefits and downsides of various algorithms, as well as offer recommendations for content authors, developers, and platform designers to ensure that their educational materials meet accessibility criteria.
 
The research actively contributes to the larger goal of improving the safety and accessibility of online information for persons who are prone to photosensitive seizures by examining and debating these specific factors. The findings will be extremely useful to web developers, educators, and regulators seeking to create all-encompassing digital environments that promote user safety and well-being.
